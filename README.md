# Heart_Monitering_System
Creating a system that allows users to monitor their body vitals and remotely send data to healthcare professionals involves using sensors to measure vital signs and establishing a communication channel to transmit the data.
For this example, we'll focus on measuring blood pressure, blood sugar level, and heart rate using appropriate sensors and then using an IoT-based communication module to send the data remotely.

Components Required:

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno or Arduino Mega)
Blood pressure sensor module (e.g., MPX5010DP)
Blood sugar level sensor (e.g., Glucometer module)
Heart rate sensor module (e.g., Pulse sensor module)
Wi-Fi module (ESP8266 or ESP32)
Breadboard and jumper wires
Power supply (battery or USB cable)
